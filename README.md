# SQL-Overview
A walkthrough of my SQL skills and how I organize and query data in SQL. 

In the "bookshop_skills.sql" code I show some examples of simple SQL data querying. 
I create fictional bookstore data tables and walk you through how I use commands to organize and analyze data. 

Includes: 

-- Structuring and building a tidy database and data tables within a schema

-- Editing, updating, and importing data 

-- Simple querying and sub-querying including basic commands like SUM, GROUP BY, and Joins 

-- Creating stored views, functions, and procedures

-- Using aliases and structuring data for performance
